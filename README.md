# Executive Summary

In the years 2009-2012, Futbol Club Barcelona (Spain) came up with a unique strategy widely known as "Tiki-Taka". In this style of play, the entire team comes together in a cluster and maintain control of the ball in that cluster. Following the Tiki-Taka strategy, Barcelona won 14 titles from 2008 to 2014. However, other club managers quickly devised counter-strategies to Tiki-Taka. These counter-strategies were so effective against Tiki-Taka that it practically died soon after 2012. 

There does not exist a universal strategy that will always win the game. We expect, however, like most strategy games, there exist an assortment of viable strategies, each with its own winning and losing match-ups. As such, question we seek to answer is: do European football teams develop multiple meta-game strategies (metas)? If so, how do different metas interact with each other and how can we use these winning relationships to find the best strategy against a specific opponent?
